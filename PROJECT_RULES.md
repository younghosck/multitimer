- Code must be compatible with Android SDK 21 and iOS 12.0.
- Avoid external packages unless explicitly requested or standard (like dio, shared_preferences).
- Styling: Minimalist, Soft UI, Pastel colors.
- Always implement explicit types for variables and functions.
- Do not use complex shaders; optimize for performance on 2019-era devices.
